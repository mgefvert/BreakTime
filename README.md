# BreakTime

C# program that forces you to take a break away from the keyboard every so often.

It allows you to set intervals for yourself, like a long break every hour with a short break in between; 
it allows to you snooze up to two times; and it's powered by a really cool state machine (somehow that feels
unimportant).

And, it's rather pretty.
